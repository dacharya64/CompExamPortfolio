I&rsquo;m interested in better understanding the GMing process in order to help inform the creation of computational tools to help support GMs running TTRPGs. Here I discuss the creation process for a prototype of a computational support tool for GMs, informed by this interview process. </span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c6 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Findings from the interviews conducted showed two major areas in which GMs could be further supported. The first area is in information visualization. GMs tended to have a lot of information to parse and remember, whether they were running a game based on a detailed game module or creating their own world for the game. Finding this information reliably during play and keeping track of this information (such as who players have met or where they have been) is difficult and has to be done quickly and reliably because of the improvisational and real-time nature of play. I also found that new GMs found the improvisational part of GMing difficult, and having a computational system that could provide suggestions and creativity support for new GMs would be helpful to remove some of the barrier to entry for new GMs and scaffold the GMing process. While the prototype I&rsquo;ve created so far only covers the information visualization part of supporting GMs, it also lays the groundwork necessary for creating a creativity support assistant for GMs, which I will discuss in more detail below. </span></p><h2 class="c4 c26" id="h.eibd2trimf66"><span>Play progression graphs for </span><span class="c21 c7 c25">Lost Mine of Phandelver</span></h2><p class="c10"><span class="c6 c7"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c6 c7"></span></p><p class="c11 c16"><span>To begin this project, I wanted to see how I might map out the possibility space of a TTRPG module.

The object also contains information on the connections between nodes--for example, each location contains an array of characters in that location, each character contains an array of the information they know, and information can lead to new locations or other information.

After conducting another round of interviews with GMs about these graphs, I got insights into more ways that digital tools might be helpful to GMs, including advice about making a queryable database that GMs can use to quickly find important information such as lists of characters in certain locations or lists of quests that a character has to offer. To that end, I decided to create a web interface for accessing and editing a database that contains information about the characters, locations, and other elements of the game world taken from the JSON files that I had already created. I decided to use logic programming language Prolog as the backend language for my database because it would allow me to do complex queries on information about the world that would be particularly helpful if offering up creative suggestions to the GM for what could happen next. I talk more about this in the next section. </span></p><h3 class="c22" id="h.pjrvinyv7kjq"><span class="c32 c7 c27">Prolog and complex queries </span></h3><p class="c11"><span class="c6 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To begin, I wrote a python parser to convert all of my JSON structures into Prolog representation for the module information. All of the entities in the world are represented with an array of the details associated with them so that I can easily query the database for all information about a given entity (ex. character) by querying for the character and each element in that array. As an example, let&rsquo;s take the character Pip, from before. To begin, we have an array that represents the details about the character: </span></p><a id="t.bdfa73efca860dd726287eadc0c24065cd12a86b"></a><a id="t.3"></a><table class="c15"><tbody><tr class="c23"><td class="c20" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c0"><span class="c5">character_info_list</span><span class="c3">(pip, [first_name, status, friend_of, knows_info]).</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c11"><span class="c6 c7">From this, we know that Pip has a first name, status, he is a friend of another character, and he knows some information. These are represented in Prolog as: </span></p><a id="t.9d6f79375b1477631e6534c91fbc1b143b6caaf6"></a><a id="t.4"></a><table class="c15"><tbody><tr class="c23"><td class="c20" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c0"><span class="c5">character</span><span class="c3">(pip).<br></span><span class="c5">first_name</span><span class="c3">(pip, pip).<br></span><span class="c5">status</span><span class="c3">(pip, alive).<br></span><span class="c5">friend_of</span><span class="c3">(pip, carp).<br></span><span class="c5">knows_info</span><span class="c9 c3">(pip, secret_tunnel_knowledge).</span></p><p class="c0 c31"><span class="c3 c9"></span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c11"><span>The first element of each of these is the character&rsquo;s tag (usually represented as </span><span class="c3">firstname_lastname</span><span>, or just </span><span class="c13 c7">firstname</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span>if the character does not have a last name). This tag is used as a reference by other entities; for instance, to say that Pip is at Stonehill Inn, I use the representation </span><span class="c5">char_in_location</span><span class="c3">(stonehill_inn, pip). </span><span class="c6 c7">I can then use Prolog queries to get all of the information about a given character, location, etc. by just iterating through the array of details and then display the information using JavaScript (JS) / HTML as a frontend. For example, I query for a list of all the characters using: </span></p><a id="t.f3bc88b8efb14d7ed0bfde5705fb7715813c01d0"></a><a id="t.5"></a><table class="c15"><tbody><tr class="c23"><td class="c20" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c0"><span class="c3">session.query(</span><span class="c13 c7">&quot;character(Char), character_info_list(Char, Char_Info_List).&quot;</span><span class="c3">)</span><span class="c7 c14">;</span><span class="c3"><br>session.answers(get_callback(get_all_bindings))</span><span class="c14 c7">;</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c11"><span>This will get me all of the instances of bindings where there is a character Char that has a list of information (the array used to hold the character details). In this case, Char is a variable that is the same for </span><span class="c5">character</span><span class="c3">(Char)</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c5">character_info_list</span><span class="c3">(Char, Char_Info_List)</span><span class="c6 c7">&nbsp;and Prolog looks for and binds to this variable all instances where it finds this pattern in the database. This produces a list that I can save to a JS variable, and iterate through to get the individual values of all of a character&rsquo;s details. For instance, given a list of character tags and a list of character detail arrays given from the earlier code, I can use: </span></p><a id="t.7f4f2e442b95b0a4363b029c4a9d5292e18a7795"></a><a id="t.6"></a><table class="c15"><tbody><tr class="c23"><td class="c20" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c0"><span class="c3">session.query(</span><span class="c13 c7">&quot;Pred = &quot;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;+ character_info_list</span><span class="c13 c7">[i]</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;+ </span><span class="c13 c7">&quot;, findall([Pred, Info], call( Pred, &quot;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;+ character_tag + </span><span class="c13 c7">&quot;, Info), List).&quot;</span><span class="c3">);</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c11"><span>This gets me each individual detail about a character (such as </span><span class="c3">secret_tunnel_knowledge </span><span>from the statement &nbsp;</span><span class="c5">knows_info</span><span class="c3">(pip, secret_tunnel_knowledge).</span><span class="c6 c7">) so I can add each entry to a table to display to the user. I talk more about this in the next section. </span></p><p class="c11 c16"><span class="c6 c7">Prolog can also be used for more complex queries that can let the user find out specific information about the world state. Using Prolog queries and searching through the database for valid bindings for those queries allows the user to specify patterns that might be difficult to find otherwise. For instance, this can be used to find interesting story content like relationships and dynamics between characters, for instance serving up a list of characters who are friendly with each other but are from factions that oppose one another to get a Romeo and Juliet-type dynamic. This can also be used to set up interesting events in the world based on the consequences of player actions. For example, if the players leave the town of Phandalin but have not dealt with the Redbrand leader, the GM might have the Redbrands expand their power by taking over the town. These are either queries that could potentially be searched up by a GM in a future iteration of this project, or used by a computational system for providing suggestions to GMs by checking for pre-conditions on suggestions for what can happen next in the game world based on what has already happened.</span></p><h3 class="c22" id="h.mnsn629ik7pb"><span class="c7 c27 c32">Creating an interactive database</span></h3><p class="c11"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By querying a Prolog database as described in the previous section, I created a web interface for displaying information from the module </span><span class="c21">Lost Mine of Phandelver</span><span class="c6 c7">, displaying the information in a table like so: </span></p><p class="c11"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 289.33px;"><img alt="" src="images/image6.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 289.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">A list of locations in </span><span class="c1 c21 c29">Lost Mine of Phandelver</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c6 c7">At first, I represented all entities in the module as either a kind of &ldquo;character,&rdquo; &ldquo;location,&rdquo; or &ldquo;piece of information.&rdquo; After further looking at examples of information in the module, the &ldquo;information&rdquo; type was broken up into &ldquo;character knowledge,&rdquo; &ldquo;quests,&rdquo; and &ldquo;conditionals.&rdquo; Character knowledge represents information that characters have and can pass on to players, quests represent requests that NPCs have (and possibly give rewards to players for completing), and conditionals represent a kind of NPC AI, or ways that characters will act under certain circumstances. </span></p><p class="c11 c16"><span>The next step in my process was making this database interactive. GMs should be able to search through different entries, as well as add, edit, and remove them from the database as needed. Implementing search is relatively simple--typing in the search bar updates a variable </span><span class="c13 c7">filterString</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span>with the value of the search, and the function displaying rows in the table first looks through all the values in the table row to see if there is a match with the value of </span><span class="c13 c7">filterString</span><span class="c6 c7">. If there is not, the function does not display that table entry. For adding entries, I created a form that the user can fill out that, when submitted, creates a Prolog assertion that adds that entity&rsquo;s information to the Prolog database, then redisplays the table so that the new entry is visible. All entities must have a tag, but all other fields in the form are optional. For instance, adding a character named Toblin Stonehill to the world looks like: </span></p><a id="t.a1d606f939976cf2f5afefa4fd480984e6b802fb"></a><a id="t.7"></a><table class="c15"><tbody><tr class="c23"><td class="c20" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c0"><span class="c5">asserta</span><span class="c3">(character(toblin_stonehill)). </span><span class="c5">asserta</span><span class="c3">(first_name(toblin_stonehill, </span><span class="c13 c7">&quot;Toblin&quot;</span><span class="c3">)). </span><span class="c5">asserta</span><span class="c3">(last_name(toblin_stonehill , </span><span class="c13 c7">&quot;Stonehill&quot;</span><span class="c3">)). </span><span class="c5">asserta</span><span class="c3">(character_info_list(toblin_stonehill, [ first_name,last_name])).</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c12"><span>These assertions are generated from the values inputted in the form. Deleting an entity works similarly, with </span><span class="c13 c7">retract</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span>statements generated instead of </span><span class="c13 c7">asserta</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span>statements to remove something from the world. Finally, editing an entry first </span><span class="c13 c7">retract</span><span class="c6 c7">s that entry from the world, and moves the values of that table row to the form for adding a new character/location/etc. Then when the user edits and submits that form, the new entry is added to the database. </span></p><p class="c12"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 234.67px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 234.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c6 c1">Conditional page with form for adding a new conditional</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c6 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, there are a few additional features to the database frontend. Firstly, I wanted to make sure that the user would be able to quickly reference interconnected elements of the game state, such as quickly seeing what quest is associated with a particular character. To that end, any entry in the table that is a tag of another entry (for instance, the character&rsquo;s list of quests is a set of quest tags) is hyperlinked to that given entry in the database. For instance, clicking the name of a quest that a character has takes you to the quest page and scrolls down to the entry in the table, highlighting the tag in yellow so it is easy to spot. </span></p><p class="c12"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 285.33px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.gif" style="width: 624.00px; height: 285.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c6 c1">GIF of clicking a hyperlink</span></p><p class="c12"><span>I also reimplemented the graph visualization of ways that the players can progress in the story discussed in the </span><span class="c17"><a class="c19" href="#h.eibd2trimf66">first part</a></span><span class="c6 c7">&nbsp;of this writeup using Prolog queries instead of DataScript queries.

I present first steps in this direction, describing how I represented information from the game module and displayed this in an interactive table and graph visualization. In the future, I hope to continue working on this project, exploring how I might be able to provide an interface that is quicker and easier for GMs to use on the fly, create better visualizations for what has already happened in the game world such as a log of player actions, and provide creative suggestions for what can happen next in the game world as a creative support tool for new GMs. </span></p><p class="c11"><span>You can try out the tool at: </span><span class="c17"><a class="c19" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.devi-a.com/PhandelverProlog/index.html&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1621290536279000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0dMBEXjrp9vFkCv-OeCJyT">https://www.devi-a.com/PhandelverProlog/index.html</a></span><span>&nbsp; </span></p></body></html>
